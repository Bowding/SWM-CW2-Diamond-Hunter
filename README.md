author: Ning WANG psynw1

Map viewer usage:
1. Choose the item you want to add in the tool bar at the bottom of the window
2. Click at the position you want to add to on the map
3. Click at another position if you changed your mind
4. Click OK button to save your settings if you are satisfied with them

If no error message is popped out, your settings are saved successfully! : )

Additional info:
Two .jar files are saved in bin folder. One is the entry to the Map Viewer application, named DiamondHunter_MapViewer.jar. The other, DiamondHunter_Game.jar, is the main entry to the Diamond Hunter game. 

Besides, to make sure these .jar files can find the given file path, the Resources folder is copied into bin.
